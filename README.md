## Introduction


The data set has been sourced from Zillow, a leading real estate and rental marketplace dedicated to empowering consumers with data and knowledge. The original data set is comprised of house sales over a 22 year span in over 14,000 zip codes in the United States. The data will be evaluated and cleaned prior to analysis and modeling.

## Methodology

First, the data set will be used to calculate the return on investment (ROI) of each zip code from the time period following the 2008 market crash until current day. The zip codes will then be ranked according to the ROI in descending order.

The second step is to conduct market research to identify the real estate markets forecasted to have high growth potential. Then using the ROI data and market research, the top 10 or 11 zip codes will be identified and used for modeling in step 3.
